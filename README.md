# Simplistic Python Module Template

This is a
[cookiecutter](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
template for creating a simplistic Python project this not
much more than a functional unit test setup, with pytest
configured as the default test runner.

To create a project, install cookiecutter into your virtual
environment, and execute it:

    pip install cookiecutter
    cookiecutter gh:HolgerPeters/simplistic-pytest-template

## Notes

The goal of this template is to easily create a
project that is ready for test-driven development with
pytest.
